                    <div class="project-description">
                        <p>Parking is inefficient all around given that in urban areas where parking demand is high but
                            available
                            options are scarce. Typically, drivers struggle to find a parking spot and spend an average
                            of
                            nearly 20 minutes in pursuit of a coveted spot. There's usually 7 a.m. street cleaning and
                            there
                            are hours when you cannot park your car at a given place. Sometimes, they have to wait long
                            before
                            someone leaves, so they can park. In a similar manner, there are problems of last dash
                            occupancies
                            where they spot an empty parking place, but another driver claims the spot within a short
                            time
                            window. However, in this day and age of digitization, a new online parking marketplace that
                            lets
                            owners of private parking areas rent out space to drivers can reduce a lot hassle involved
                            in finding parking spots. It would be so much easier if the drivers could reserve a parking
                            spot, or even “rent” one for as long as they need.
                        </p>
                        <p>In Syracuse, driving to work or school can sometimes be a hassle because faculty and
                            students usually
                            arrive on four wheels. They occasionally worry about alternate side parking, meters,
                            parking tickets and all other parking regulations. As we can see, they have trouble finding
                            a
                            parking space and waste a lot of time on doing so. In fact, cars are on the road for about
                            only
                            5-10% of the time and take up valuable space when not in use. Therefore, we came up with the
                            idea
                            of an online marketplace for shared parking application that is an Airbnb-like service for a
                            parking. We could see this working on a college campus.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, garage owners with some extra space in their driveways can make a few bucks
                            because the driveways often sit idle when they are at work or out of town. The parking spot
                            providers can post their available spot for rent. As a result, the drivers no longer need to
                            worry
                            about parking tickets as well as losing their prized spots to another driver. This online
                            parking
                            application can assist them to find and compare spots, get contact details of parking spot
                            owner and
                            send notifications to them when they are near the address. The parking space providers must
                            let
                            the drivers know of any restrictions, for example they cannot block the driveway or other
                            paths.
                        </p>
                        <p>The application will show the drivers where the closest or safest places (such as proximity
                            campus safety lights) are to their destination to park. The drivers can reserve a spot in
                            advance
                            with their credit cards and obtain discounts for early reservations or setup recurring
                            reservations.
                        </p>
                        <p>All users of the app must provide contact information in the form of a username, password,
                            valid
                            email address, and payment information. The payment information will be in the form of a
                            PayPal
                            Account. Additionally, drivers must provide a description of their car
                            (make/model/color/license
                            plate) and parking spot providers must provide a description of their parking spot (price,
                            location,
                            size,photo, and restrictions).
                        </p>
                        <p>There are plenty of parking apps out there that help you find and book a parking spot, but
                            why an
                            online marketplace for shared parking application is significantly different (and totally
                            amazing)
                            is that people could yield profit by this app. The app will help connect owners of private
                            parking
                            spots to drivers looking for parking, and help drivers to pay parking fee to the owners.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, it makes life easier, our cities more accessible, and people in Syracuse more
                            connected
                            thereby developing convenient and effective ways to find , reserve and easily pay for
                            parking.
                            The drivers only need to book a parking space near their destinations before leaving home.
                            So
                            they do not struggle to find and waste time on looking for a parking spot anymore, and it
                            prevents
                            them from building up parking ticket fees.
                        </p>
                        <p>It also enables drivers to save time on the road and reduce the nation's carbon footprint
                            because
                            typically the drivers spend an average of nearly 20 minutes in finding a parking spot as
                            well
                            as losing a parking spaces to other drivers.
                        </p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the application targets the core of the problem by offering a solution to
                            alleviate
                            the trouble of finding parking spaces. Through the application, owners can capitalize by
                            renting
                            out private spaces during times of underutilization, and drivers can seamlessly make
                            reservations
                            for spaces based on location and convenience. Owners can schedule spaces for durations that
                            seem
                            convenient for them, thus allowing them to make adjustments to when they can and cannot
                            offer
                            their space. Similarly, drivers can browse through a plethora of parking spaces in and
                            around
                            their intended destination, make recurring bookings based on space availability. The
                            application
                            is also flexible in a way that drivers can make another choice for a nearby location, in
                            case
                            an extension needs to be made and the space has been rented out for that duration.</p>

                                <p>ParkPlace is a new self-contained web application. As with all web applications, it
                                    adopts
                                    a client-server model for authentication, authorization and communication. The goal
                                    of
                                    the application is to make the process of finding parking spots easy and
                                    hassle-free.
                                    More than often, we find ourselves meandering around, desperately looking for
                                    parking
                                    areas. This can especially be seen in busy areas with limited to almost no spaces
                                    for
                                    parking. Designated public parking is one solution to the problem. However, people
                                    usually
                                    need to spend unreasonably high amounts of money for relatively short periods of
                                    parking
                                    time. This problem is addressed by ParkPlace in an easy and efficient manner.
                                </p>
                                <p>The client part of the application is constituted by the owner and driver. The
                                    server side
                                    of the application is modeled using ‘Firebase’ as the primary authentication and
                                    authorization
                                    server. The application logic/business logic is implemented with Express as the
                                    routing
                                    layer, built on top of the Node(Node.js) JavaScript runtime environment. The
                                    primary
                                    database is MongoDB. This is used for storing data such as user data, parking spot
                                    data,
                                    and booking and scheduling data. </p>
                                <p>The crux of the application is a convenient and flexible booking system. The owner
                                    and driver
                                    schemas/models are interdependent in the sense that a booking made by the driver
                                    must
                                    reflect on the owner’s side of the interface. Also, map projections of parking
                                    spaces
                                    will be provided for drivers as an easy and intuitive alternative to the
                                    conventional

                                    The operating
                                    environment for the system consists of a browser that renders web pages, an

                                    <li>One of the key constraints of the system is the inherent reliability on an
                                        internet connection.
                                        Since the product is implemented using the client-server model, it is
                                        imperative
                                        to have an active internet connection</li>
                                    <li>Another important constraint is the electronic payment and booking system.
                                        Although electronic
                                        payment streamlines the payment and booking process, the system needs to
                                        support
                                        round the clock interactions with the payment gateway.</li>
                                    <li>Administrative responsibility is relegated to the PaaS vendor. As a result,
                                        managing
                                        the application becomes a little tricky for the local administrative team.</li>
                                    <li>Developing and handling booking cancellation policies may turn out to be
                                        tricky.</li>

                                    design and development. This suggests that the website must respond to users’
                                    behavior
                                    and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.</p>
                                <p>The product is expected to behave consistently across all device platforms. Each

                                    is expected to see a welcome screen after visiting the website. The welcome screen
                                    generally
                                    provides information to the user about product intentions and features. In

                                    each user must have access to registration and authentication screens (sign-up and
                                    login).
                                    The owner is expected to see a dashboard page that lets him/her view the number of
                                    parking
                                    spots he/she has published, a page with an embedded form for entering new parking
                                    spot
                                    details for publishing, a parking spot edit/ update page and a widget for removing

                                <p>Coming to the drivers’ section of the interface, a search widget needs to be
                                    provided for
                                    looking for parking spots. A page showing search results consisting of parking
                                    spots
                                    in and around the searched location, and a map representation of the same needs to
                                    be
                                    designed and developed. Associated booking and confirmation web pages need to be
                                    provided.</p>

                <p>As web development matured and interactivity came to the fore, single page applications became more
                    popular. An SPA is a web application paradigm that avoids refreshing a web page to display new
                    content; it
                    instead uses lightweight calls to the server to get some data or snippets and updates the web page.
