                        <p>Home security and privacy is a something people are always worried about in this day of age.
                            After all, anything can happen if you are not careful and there is stuff in our life we are
                            not ready to share. Since life is unpredictable, people want to feel safe and secure. Not
                            only that people want safety but they want control over their safety and privacy. This is
                            probably why people are purchasing home automation system, surveillance cameras, alert
                            systems and security systems for their house. These devices are not 100% foolproof but
                            there is a layer of protection. Mainly it is the protection of security and privacy. There
                            is even a device that alerts people when a door is opened. We created this exact system.
                        </p>
                        <p>With our system, people will know not only that door has been touched but also who has used
                            your door. Moreover, the individual is sent a photo through email regarding the door
                            activity. This door opening system also comes equipped with a video capture and streaming
                            option. The paper is about our project of a door opening alert system. This paper will go
                            in depth on the design of the door opening entry alert system, our approaches of doing so,
                            our results and observations from constructing the door opening entry alert system. In
                            addition, this paper will go over some of the features that our door opening system
                            possesses. Also, we will discuss the hardware used to construct our door opening system. It
                            might be for your entire house, your room will never be more secure. Ultimately this paper
                            is talking about the creation of our door opening system. </p>
                        <p>The objective of my project is to create a door opening system with video capture and
                            streaming capabilities. The platform used for the door opening alert system is the Beagle
                            Bone Black, and the Operating System for this system is Debian. The communications used
                            in this system is SMTP protocol, email: The door opening alert system will notify the user
                            via email. The email will consist of a photo capture, the date, and the time of the photo
                            capture. The email sends the user the photo captured the moment a person opens the door.
                            The email will be in the userâ€™s inbox in a short time, and so will the video be able to
                            capture to the user in specified time, and the sensors for the Door Opening Entry Alert
                            system can be implemented with a PIR motion detector. Since this system can run for 24
                            hours per day and 7 days a week, Door Opening Entry Alert System has to be connected to the
                            internet all the time. The relevance to this system is for home security and a piece of
                            mind. The system will notify you if anyone or anything is entering your property at any
                            time. As a result, the user will know who, when and what was messing with your property.
                            Because of its photo capture abilities, it can also be used to identify an individual, and
                            there is an effort to make this system cheap and considering the price of a webcam, motion
                            sensor and breadboard, the cost and the risk for this system is relatively low.

                    <h4 class="u-add-tb-margin"><strong>Methodology and Technical approach</strong></h4>
                    <p>The door opening entry alert system goes through this process. A person opens the door, and then
                        PIR sensor detects the person opening the door. Afterwards, the webcam will take the photo and
                        then emails that photo with the date and time stamp. In order to achieve this, a breadboard and
                        additional wires is required for the design. It is required to connect the PIR sensor to the
                        Beaglebone Black. Without it, the PIR sensor will not respond to the Beaglebone Black. Now the
                        photo is captured when the door is open. This works well since there is no flash on these USB
                        webcams.</p>
                    <p>As a result, the person will not know that their picture captured and send to the user. One
                        problem is that sometimes it does not capture the entire person when the photo is captured.
                        However, this depends on where the camera is positioned. The email sent to the user consists of
                        the date and time of the photo and the photo itself. This was a plan to have the system use a
                        network adapter so the system does not have to connect to the computer. The reason we did not
                        include is it is easier to use the Ethernet cable. After all, everybody has an Ethernet cable
                        in the home.</p>

                    <p>The program for sending a simple email message with attachment, capturing a photo via
                        USB cam, and motion detector are written in python language. These modules are
                        completed, but they are still separated and just test cases. Therefore, to verify the system,
                        the separated modules need to be combined into one file and tested together. The
                        BeagleBone Black needs to connect to the power and the internet all the time to work
                        properly. However, the pictures that we received have high noise and are not that
                        obvious, especially during night time. Currently, we implement the system with simple
                        USBcam due to low budget; nevertheless, it would be much better if we can implement
                        this system with a high definition camera including advanced night vision feature so that
                        we can receive a high-resolution photo. Similarly, the range of this normal PIR motion
                        detector is not that far. Thus, it would be much better if we can implement this system
                        with PIR motion detector providing further range. If we change these hardware
                        equipment, we will definitely obtain a better result and performance even though this new
                        hardware equipment costs a lot of money.

                    <p>Overall, the system works the way it was designed. Our approach was good. The motion sensor was
                        able to detect motion; the photo capture module captured a photo when the door is opened. We got
                        the door opening entry alert system finished an one week early. Adding the video capture module
                        is something we decided to add at the spare of moment. However, the video capture works well
                        especially with the Logitech C920. We are generally happy with how this system turned out. Our
                        results are shown below.</p>
