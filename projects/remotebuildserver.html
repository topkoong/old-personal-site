                        <p>In general, software development is complex, especially as applications, teams, and
                            deployment infrastructure
                            grow in complexity themselves. Also, software projects involve lots of files consist of a
                            great
                            number of packages and million lines of codes so keeping track of all of these becomes an
                            intolerable
                            burden, and it is arduous and time-consuming when developers attempt to merge their
                            accumulated
                            code changes. These factors combined makes it harder to deliver updates to customers
                            quickly.
                            Hence, with the Remote Build Server concept that efficiently and strongly supports
                            continuous
                            integration, it considerably enhances software quality and development process, and
                            developers
                            can catch bugs early, spend less time debugging, and deliver software more rapidly. Our
                            Federation
                            of servers contains Client Mock, Repository Mock, Test Harness Mock, and Build Server, each
                            providing
                            a dedicated service for continuous integration, and top level of eleven major packages are
                            the
                            following: Client Mock, Repository Mock, Test Harness Mock, Sender, Parser, Builder, File
                            Manager,
                            Logger, File Handler, Environment Manager, and Build. Each package is accurately described
                            in
                            the Partition section. In addition, users of the Remote Build Server are Developers,
                            Project
                            Managers, Quality Assurance (QA), SMA Instructor and Teaching Assistants. How they will
                            interact
                            with the application is described in detail. Rational and technical explanation for each
                            user

                        in Repository
                        for packaging into a test library, a test element specifying driver and tested files, added to
                        a
                        build request structure. The GUI will display which selected files client added to build Then,
                        the
                        client builds a build request to generate an XML build request, and the GUI will display the
                        build
                        request structure that the client has just created. After that, the client selects newly
                        generated
                        build requests and send them to the Repository Mock, and the GUI will display that client has
                        transferred
                        the build request structure and XML build request files successfully. Then, the Mother Builder
                        will
                        receive a build request message forwarded by Repo and check the ready message queue to see
                        which
                        child processes are available. Once it found that there’s a child process available, it will
                        send
                        a build request message to that child process. When the child builder receives a build request
                        message,
                        it will deserialize the XML build request and asks repo for the cited files. Once it receives
                        those
                        required files, it will build test libraries if there are more than one test element, generate
                        an
                        XML test request and send the log to Repo and test libraries to Test Harness. Test Harness will
                        then
                        check a test request message, and if there is a test request message, it will deserialize the
                        XML
                        test request and loading test assemblies into application domain, recording pass status,
                        logging
                        execution details, sending test result to Repository. After that, the client can view the test
                        logs
                        and build logs from GUI.

                                    between
                                    two threads using an instance of the queue. If the queue is empty when a reader
                                    attempts
                                    to dequeue an item, the reader will block until the writing thread enqueues an
                                    item.

                                            empty queue is blocked until some other thread inserts an item into the
                                            queue.
                                            A thread trying to enqueue an item in a full queue is blocked until some

                                            thread makes space in the queue, either by dequeuing one or more items or
                                            clearing
                                            the queue completely. In a similar manner, applying multithreading to this
